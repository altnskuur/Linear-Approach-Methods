# Linear-Approach-Methods

This project includes linear aprroach methods. These methods are Cholesky (direct method), Gauss Seidel and CGM (Conjugate Gradiant Method). 

These algorithms are written in MATLAB with version R2022b. All of algorithms in a function. The function takes 3 inputs for Ax=b system. First one A matrix, second one b vector, and the last one is Method. Methods are selecting with a number. Number 1 is Cholesky, number 2 is Gauss Seidel, and number 3 is CGM. If input method parameter is not in this range, algorithm will return 0 vector.
